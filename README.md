# Plasma-nvim

## This is the configuration file for my neovim.

## Features
* Packer for package installations
* Treesitter for code highlighting
* LSP-Zero for code completion and suggestions
* Custom themes
* Custom keybindings

This is made to my liking, but you can definitely configure it according to yours.
